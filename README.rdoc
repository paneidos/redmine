= Redmine

Redmine is a flexible project management web application written using Ruby on Rails framework.

More details can be found at http://www.redmine.org

This fork is supposed to be Rails 3 compatible.

Currently not working:
- Some tests;
- The error_messages_for call doesn't work, there seems to be an issue with dynamic_form;
- Mail notifications. The message is built, but calling deliver raises exceptions so it's disabled (Mailer needs to be rewritten);
- Custom fields validations is not working properly (Query needs to be rewritten);
